    "name": "Richard 'Richie' Hawtin",
    "bio": "Hawtin was born in Banbury, Oxfordshire, England, but at the age of nine moved to LaSalle, Ontario, a suburb of Windsor, Ontario. His father worked as a robotics technician at General Motors and was a fan of electronic music, introducing his son to Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream at an early age. He has one brother, Matthew, who is a visual artist and ambient music DJ. Hawtin attended Sandwich Secondary High School in LaSalle. He began to DJ in clubs in Detroit at 17, and his early style was a mix of house music and techno. With Canadian DJ John Acquaviva he formed the label Plus 8 in 1989 to release his own tracks under the name F.U.S.E., whose 'Approach and Identify 12' is closely associated with the origins of the IDM subgenre. He dropped out of the University of Windsor, where he was studying film, and Plus 8 went on to release material by artists such as Speedy J and Kenny Larkin. Hawtin adopted his Plastikman incarnation in 1993 releasing the iconic percussive single 'Spastik' and parent album 'Sheet One', going on to release a number of albums and touring a live show for the next decade. In 1996 Hawtin released a series of monthly 12-inch singles, entitled Concept 1 which, alongside the work of Robert Hood, pioneered the Minimal techno style. His M_nus label also pursued this direction. In 1999 the 'Decks, EFX & 909 mix album', the first in a series of three, set new standards for technological input, including 38 tracks molded via effects and drum machines. In 2006, he collaborated with choreographer Enzo Cosimi on a composition called '9.20' for the Winter Olympics opening ceremony. In 2012 Hawtin worked with Loco Dice and Ean Golden in promoting Electronic Dance Music on a tour of North American universities entitled CNTRL: Beyond EDM, which included music production seminars, lessons in the music business, and live music performances. Since 2012 Hawtin has presented ENTER. at Space in Ibiza during the summer season, promoted via an acclaimed marketing campaign featuring a black dot. ENTER. consists of five specially designed rooms and a wide array of electronic music. Due to Hawtin's love of sake and Japanese culture ENTER. also has a sake bar that sells its own brand of sake, produced in a collaboration with Kyoto's Sookuu Sake Company. Hawtin's successes in music technology were affirmed in July 2015, when he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music Technology by the University of Huddersfield.",

    "name": "Carl Cox",
    "bio": "Carl Cox is a British DJ, house and techno producer. In the 1980s, Cox was a breakbeat hardcore playa and became a mainstay DJ in the electronica industry. He has performed at numerous clubs and events worldwide and has served as a monthly DJ for BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix. He has hosted a residency known as 'Music is Revolution' every summer season at the world renowned nightclub, Space Ibiza, from 2001 to 2016. He runs the record label, Intec Digital, which was founded in 1999 as Intec Records. Cox also had his own radio show, entitled 'Global'. In 2017 he announced that from February onwards he would no longer work on the show. He has featured his own 'Carl Cox & Friends' stage at many festivals, such as Ultra Music Festival, the BPM Festival, Awakenings. At the age of fifteen years, Cox began working as a mobile DJ, finding a passion for disco music. He began his music career around the same time that Chicago house music found its forefront in the world of dance music. He eventually became known as one of the founders of that sound and rode the exploding British rave scene. Following the beginning of his DJ career, he became one of the only DJs known to utilize three-deck mixing. Cox has performed at clubs such as The Eclipse, Edge, Shelley's Laserdome, Sterns Nightclub, Heaven, Sir Henry's in Cork, Ireland and Angels and The Haçienda, as well as raves for Fantazia, Dreamscape, NASA and Amnesia House. In the early 1990s, he decided that it was time to begin producing music, which is when he released his debut single for Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto label, 'I Want You (Forever)'. Cox became known as one of the best 'celebrity DJs' in the world, and he continued to create music, eventually embracing the underground sounds of techno that would soon become very popular. He ran Ultimate Base at the now defunct Velvet Underground club on Charing Cross Road, London in the mid-to late 1990s. Cox also played the Millennium (1999 to 2000) on New Year's Eve twice, by performing in Sydney, Australia and again in Hawaii after flying back over the International Date Line. He was also global resident DJ for BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix in 1998–99 and he has also broadcast over a decade's-worth of Ibiza live mixes from Space. In 1997, DJ Magazine chose Cox as the first #1 DJ for its first top 100 poll, which to this day still takes place. Cox formed his own record label, Intec Records in 1998. From 1999 to 2006, Intec Records released a myriad of underground hits and became one of the best in dance music. However, in 2006 he decided to put the label on a brief hiatus and relaunched it in 2010 as Intec Digital. Carl Cox is also famously known for shouting catchphrases during his sets such as 'Oh yes, Oh yes!' and 'fantastic, fannntastic!'.",
